#ERROS WITH MY APP

-My app doesnt save the files i tried my best, but i ran out of time as i am still facing exams, i hope that sir understands the struggle that i went through designing this app and i hope sir won't say i copied this time, i was taking some other ideas on the codelabs you provided, bear in mind that this year was my first time doing android studio so im struggling a bit but what's important to keep on learning. 
Thank you sir.
